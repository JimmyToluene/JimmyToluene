## Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I'm currently working on automated perivascular spaces (PVS) segmentation from brain MRI using 3D deep learning
- 🌱 I'm currently learning advanced medical image analysis, cross-site generalization, and the MONAI framework
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on neuroimaging ML projects and medical image segmentation challenges
- 💬 Ask me about PyTorch, MONAI, brain MRI preprocessing, or 3D U-Net architectures
- 📫 How to reach me: jimmyjia@bu.edu
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: My model might be detecting more perivascular spaces than the tool it was trained on

## Hi there 👋

- I'm currently working on csvd related biomarker segmentation from brain MRI using 3D deep learning
- I'm currently learning advanced medical image analysis, cross-site generalization, and the MONAI framework
- I'm looking to collaborate on neuroimaging ML projects and medical image segmentation challenges
- Ask me about PyTorch, MONAI, brain MRI preprocessing, or 3D U-Net architectures
- How to reach me: jimmyjia@bu.edu
